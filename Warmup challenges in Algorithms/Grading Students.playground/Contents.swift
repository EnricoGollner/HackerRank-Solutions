 HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

 Every student receives a  in the inclusive range from  0 to 100.
 Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.
 Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:
 
 If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3 (mÃ³dulo - %), round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
 If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
 
 Returns:
 int[n]: the grades after rounding as appropriate
